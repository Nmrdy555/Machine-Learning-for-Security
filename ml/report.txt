In the context of a classification report generated by a machine learning model, the "weighted avg" refers to the weighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes. Let's break down what each component means:
1.	Precision: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. A high precision indicates that the model has fewer false positives.
2.	Recall: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the ability of the model to correctly identify positive instances out of all actual positives. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
3.	F1-score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances between precision and recall. F1-score reaches its best value at 1 and worst at 0.
4.	Support: Support is the number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.
Now, for the "weighted avg" part:
•	Weighted average precision: This is the weighted average of precision for all classes, where each class's precision is weighted by the number of true instances in that class.
•	Weighted average recall: Similar to weighted average precision, this is the weighted average of recall for all classes, where each class's recall is weighted by the number of true instances in that class.
•	Weighted average F1-score: Again, this is the weighted average of F1-score for all classes, where each class's F1-score is weighted by the number of true instances in that class.
In the provided output:
weighted avg 0.25 0.50 0.33 2 
•	The weighted average precision is 0.25, recall is 0.50, and F1-score is 0.33, with a support of 2. This means that the overall performance of the model, considering all classes, is relatively low. It's essential to consider both precision and recall, as they provide complementary insights into the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets or when there are multiple classes to predict.
