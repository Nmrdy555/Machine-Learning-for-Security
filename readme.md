# Machine Learning for Security

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to enhance security measures, particularly in the context of authentication and intrusion detection. By leveraging supervised learning algorithms, the system aims to classify and predict security-related events such as login attempts and potential intrusions.

## Features
- **Login Authentication**: Predicts the likelihood of successful or failed login attempts based on historical data.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Identifies potential intrusion events by analyzing patterns and anomalies in network traffic or system logs.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time monitoring and alerts for suspicious activities.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-security.git
cd machine-learning-security

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the dataset containing security-related events such as login attempts, system logs, or network traffic data. Ensure that the dataset is appropriately formatted and labeled.

2. **Training the Model**: Train the machine learning model using the provided dataset. This involves feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to determine the most suitable algorithm for the task.

3. **Testing and Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using test data to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Adjust parameters and algorithms as necessary to optimize performance.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time monitoring and security analysis. Integrate it with existing security systems or dashboards for seamless operation.
